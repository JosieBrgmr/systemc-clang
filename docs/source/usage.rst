====================
Using systemc-clang
====================

Running ``systemc-clang`` requires setting some environment variables.  
The distribution provides some scripts that simplify this. 

Setting the environment variables
==================================

Depending on your shell, you would need to use the appropriate commands to set the following environment variables.

* ``LLVM_INSTALL_DIR``: This points to the directory where clang is installed. 
* ``SYSTEMC``: This points to the directory where SystemC is installed.
* ``SYSTEMC_CLANG_BUILD_DIR``: This points to where ``systemc-clang`` was built.
